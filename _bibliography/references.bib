 abstract = {The usual approach in runtime analysis is to derive estimates on the number of fitness function evaluations required by a method until a suitable element of the search space is found. One justification for this is that in real applications, fitness evaluation often contributes the most computational effort. A tacit assumption in this approach is that this effort is uniform and static across the search space. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice: some candidates may be far more expensive to evaluate than others. This might occur, for example, when fitness evaluation requires running a simulation or training a machine learning model. Despite the availability of a wide range of benchmark functions coupled with various runtime performance guarantees, the runtime analysis community currently lacks a solid perspective of handling variable fitness cost. Our goal with this paper is to argue for incorporating this perspective into our theoretical toolbox. We introduce two models of handling variable cost: a simple non-adaptive model together with a more general adaptive model. We prove cost bounds in these scenarios and discuss the implications for taking into account costly regions in the search space.},

@article{lehre_towards_2025,
 abstract = {The maximin optimisation problem, inspired by Von Neumann’s work (von Neumann 1928) and widely applied in adversarial optimisation, has become a key research area in machine learning. Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) is a common method for solving these problems but requires the pay-off function to be differentiable, making it unsuitable for discrete or binary functions that often occur in game-theoretical scenarios. Co-evolutionary algorithms (CoEAs), which are derivative-free, offer an alternative to these problems. However, the theoretical understanding of CoEAs is still limited. 

This paper provides the first rigorous runtime analysis of CoEAs with pairwise dominance on binary two-player zero-sum games (or maximin problems), specifically focusing on the DIAGONAL game. The mathematical analysis rigorously shows that the PDCoEA can efficiently find the optimum in polynomial runtime with high probability under low mutation rates and large population sizes. Empirical evidence also identifies an error threshold where higher mutation rates lead to inefficiency. In contrast, single-pair-individual algorithms, i.e., RLS-PD and (1+1)-CoEAs, fail to find the optimum in polynomial time. These findings highlight the usefulness of pairwise dominance, low mutation rates, and large populations in maintaining a “co-evolutionary arms race”.},

 abstract = {Coevolutionary algorithms are helpful computational abstractions of adversarial behavior and they demonstrate multiple ways that populations of competing adversaries influence one another. We introduce the ability for each competitor's mutation rate to evolve through self-adaptation. Because dynamic environments are frequently addressed with self-adaptation, we set up dynamic problem environments to investigate the impact of this ability. For a simple bilinear problem, a sensitivity analysis of the adaptive method's parameters reveals that it is robust over a range of multiplicative rate factors, when the rate is changed up or down with equal probability. An empirical study determines that each population's mutation rates converge to values close to the error threshold. Mutation rate dynamics are complex when both populations adapt their rates. Large scale empirical self-adaptation results reveal that both reasonable solutions and rates can be found. This addresses the challenge of selecting ideal static mutation rates in coevolutionary algorithms. The algorithm's payoffs are also robust. They are rarely poor and frequently they are as high as the payoff of the static rate to which they converge. On rare runs, they are higher.},

 abstract = {While some common fitness landscape characteristics are critical when determining the runtime of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), the relationship between fitness landscape structure and the runtime of EAs is poorly understood. Recently, Dang et al. (2021) introduced a classification of pseudo-Boolean problems showing that "sparsity" of local optima and the "density" of fitness valleys can be crucial characteristics when determining the runtime of EAs. However, their approach could only classify some classes of pseudo-Boolean functions and thus defined an incomplete hierarchy.We generalise the previous work to a complete hierarchy for all pseudo-Boolean functions. The hierarchy is consistent with existing results for the runtime of EAs. The hardest part of the hierarchy consists of problems satisfying the No Free Lunch theorem. The easiest part contains well-known theoretical benchmark problems, easy for EAs. The intermediary parts contain instances of NP-hard problems. Problem classes where local optima sparsity exceed fitness valley density are shown to have exponential black-box complexity. We study how random perturbations of a function can change its classification. E.g, randomly perturbing search points in OneMax with constant probability leads to a problem class that can still be optimised efficiently with appropriately tuned non-elitist EAs.},

For strategy spaces too large for a Nash equilibrium to be computed classically, this can instead be approached using a co-evolutionary algorithm. How to design coevolutionary algorithms which avoid pathological behaviours (such as cycling or forgetting) on challenging games is then a crucial open problem.We argue that runtime analysis can provide insight and inform the design of more powerful and reliable algorithms for this purpose. To this end, we consider a class of symmetric zero-sum games for which the role of population diversity is pivotal to an algorithm's success. We prove that a broad class of algorithms which do not utilise a population have superpolynomial runtime for this class. In the other direction we prove that, with high probability, a coevolutionary instance of the univariate marginal distribution algorithm finds the unique Nash equilibrium in time O(n(log n)2).Together, these results demonstrate the importance of generating diverse search points for evolving better strategies. The corresponding proofs develop several techniques that may benefit future analysis of estimation of distribution and coevolutionary algorithms.},

@inproceedings{benford_bicriteria_2024,
 abstract = {A common aim in real-world optimisation problems is to seek a solution offering highest performance on expected scenarios, but at the same time guaranteeing an at least acceptable performance on worst-case scenarios. Competitive coevolution evolves a population of solutions alongside a population of difficult scenarios in order to find so-called robust solutions. However, solutions with maximal worst-case performance often exhibit poor performance on more typical scenarios. Existing coevolutionary approaches generally favour such solutions over ones which sacrifice only a small amount of average performance for an almost as large gain in worst-case performance, despite the latter being favourable in most practical applications. We present a new coevolutionary algorithm which treats average performance and worst-case performance as two objectives of a bicriteria optimisation problem and seeks the corresponding Pareto front. Such an algorithm enables the discovery of solutions with strong performance in both of these metrics, which would otherwise be rejected if optimising for only one. Our algorithm constitutes the first coevolutionary approach to this solution concept. We also provide experimental results on the performance of this algorithm on the design of smart controllers for the management of energy flow between buildings, renewable energy sources, and electric vehicles.},

However, these algorithms are poorly understood and applications are often limited by pathological behaviour, such as loss of gradient, relative over-generalisation, and mediocre objective stasis. It is an open challenge to develop a theory that can predict when co-evolutionary algorithms find solutions efficiently and reliable. This paper provides a first step in developing runtime analysis for population-based competitive co-evolutionary algorithms. We provide a mathematical framework for describing and reasoning about the performance of co-evolutionary processes. To illustrate the framework, we introduce a population-based co-evolutionary algorithm called PDCoEA, and prove that it obtains a solution to a bilinear maximin optimisation problem in expected polynomial time. Finally, we describe settings where PDCoEA needs exponential time with overwhelmingly high probability to obtain a solution.},

@article{lehre_more_2024,
 abstract = {Real-world applications often involve “uncertain” objectives, i.e., where optimisation algorithms observe objective values as a random variables with positive variance. In the past decade, several rigorous analysis results for evolutionary algorithms (EAs) on discrete problems show that EAs can cope with low-level uncertainties, i.e. when the variance of the uncertain objective value is small, and sometimes even benefit from uncertainty. Previous work showed that a large population combined with a non-elitist selection mechanism is a promising approach to handle high levels of uncertainty. However, the population size and the mutation rate can dramatically impact the performance of non-elitist EAs, and the optimal choices of these parameters depend on the level of uncertainty in the objective function. The performance and the required parameter settings for non-elitist EAs in some common objective-uncertainty scenarios are still unknown. We analyse the runtime of non-elitist EAs on two classical benchmark problems OneMax and LeadingOnes in in the one-bit, the bitwise, the Gaussian, and the symmetric noise models, and the dynamic binary value problem (DynBV). Our analyses are more extensive and precise than previous analyses of non-elitist EAs. In several settings, we prove that the non-elitist EAs outperform the current state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we provide more precise guidance on how to choose the mutation rate, the selective pressure, and the population size as a function of the level of uncertainty.},

 abstract = {Co-evolutionary algorithms have found several applications in game-theoretic applications and optimisation problems with an adversary, particularly where the strategy space is discrete and exponentially large, and where classical game-theoretic methods fail. However, the application of co-evolutionary algorithms is difficult because they often display pathological behaviour, such as cyclic behaviour and evolutionary forgetting. These challenges have prevented the broad application of co-evolutionary algorithms. We derive, via rigorous mathematical methods, bounds on the expected time of a simple co-evolutionary algorithm until it discovers a Maximin-solution on the pseudo-Boolean Bilinear problem. Despite the intransitive nature of the problem leading to a cyclic behaviour of the algorithm, we prove that the algorithm obtains the Maximin-solution in expected O(n1.5) time. However, we also show that the algorithm quickly forgets the Maximin-solution and moves away from it. These results in a large total regret of Θ(Tn1.5) after T iterations. Finally, we show that using a simple archive solves this problem reducing the total regret significantly. Along the way, we present new mathematical tools to compute the expected time for co-evolutionary algorithms to obtain a Maximin-solution. We are confident that these tools can help further advance runtime analysis in both co-evolutionary and evolutionary algorithms.},

@article{hevia_fajardo_self-adjusting_2023,
 abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose optimisers that come with several parameters like the sizes of parent and offspring populations or the mutation rate. It is well known that the performance of EAs may depend drastically on these parameters. Recent theoretical studies have shown that self-adjusting parameter control mechanisms that tune parameters during the algorithm run can provably outperform the best static parameters in EAs on discrete problems. However, the majority of these studies concerned elitist EAs and we do not have a clear answer on whether the same mechanisms can be applied for non-elitist EAs. We study one of the best-known parameter control mechanisms, the one-fifth success rule, to control the offspring population size \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$in the non-elitist \$\$\{(1,{\textbackslash}lambda )\}\$\$ EA. It is known that the \$\$\{(1,{\textbackslash}lambda )\}\$\$ EA has a sharp threshold with respect to the choice of \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$where the expected runtime on the benchmark function OneMax changes from polynomial to exponential time. Hence, it is not clear whether parameter control mechanisms are able to find and maintain suitable values of \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$. For OneMax we show that the answer crucially depends on the success rate s (i. e. a one-\$\$(s+1)\$\$-th success rule). We prove that, if the success rate is appropriately small, the self-adjusting \$\$\{(1,{\textbackslash}lambda )\}\$\$ EA optimises OneMax in O(n) expected generations and \$\$O(n {\textbackslash}log n)\$\$expected evaluations, the best possible runtime for any unary unbiased black-box algorithm. A small success rate is crucial: we also show that if the success rate is too large, the algorithm has an exponential runtime on OneMax and other functions with similar characteristics.},

Instead, they use the aggregation of outcomes from interactions between competing solutions allowing to rank solutions and make selection decisions. This makes CoEAs a useful tool for optimisation problems that have intrinsically interactive domains. Over the past decades, many ways to aggregate the outcomes of interactions have been considered. At the moment, it is unclear which of these is the best choice. Previous research is fragmented and most of the fitness aggregation methods (fitness measures) proposed have only been studied empirically. We argue that a proper understanding of the dynamics of CoEAs and their fitness measures can only be achieved through rigorous analysis of their behaviour. In this work we make a step towards this goal by using runtime analysis to study two commonly used fitness measures. We show a dichotomy in the behaviour of a (1, Λ) CoEA when optimising a Bilinear problem. The algorithm finds a Nash equilibrium efficiently if the worst interaction is used as a fitness measure but it takes exponential time w.o.p. if the average of all interactions is used instead.},

Our methodology provides reliable comparisons and records of run and multi-run dynamics. Our supplementary material also offers enticing and detailed animations of a pair of players' game moves over the course of a game of millions of moves matched to the same run's populations' payoffs.},

 abstract = {The usual approach in runtime analysis is to derive estimates on the number of fitness function evaluations required by a method until a suitable element of the search space is found. One justification for this is that in real applications, fitness evaluation often contributes the most computational effort. A tacit assumption in this approach is that this effort is uniform and static across the search space. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice: some candidates may be far more expensive to evaluate than others. This might occur, for example, when fitness evaluation requires running a simulation or training a machine learning model. Despite the availability of a wide range of benchmark functions coupled with various runtime performance guarantees, the runtime analysis community currently lacks a solid perspective of handling variable fitness cost. Our goal with this paper is to argue for incorporating this perspective into our theoretical toolbox. We introduce two models of handling variable cost: a simple non-adaptive model together with a more general adaptive model. We prove cost bounds in these scenarios and discuss the implications for taking into account costly regions in the search space.},

 abstract = {Many Real-world optimisation tasks are increasingly large-scale optimisation (LSO) problems. Cooperative co-evolutionary algorithms (CoEAs), which involve more than two populations and utilise the divide-and-conquer approach, have been introduced to solve LSO problems more efficiently. However, the behaviour of cooperative CoEAs is not fully understood because the interactions between two or more populations make analysis challenging. Runtime analysis has improved the under-standing of traditional EAs. We argue that using runtime analysis of CoEAs could provide helpful insights, e.g., how their expected runtime depends on alaorithmic design decisions. In this paper, we show that the expected optimisation time of the basic cooperative co-evolutionary (1+1) EA (CC-(1+1) EA) on linear functions is {\textbackslash}Theta(nłog n). This solves an open conjecture by (Jansen and Wiegand, 2004). Moreover, empirical analysis is conducted on two more complicated problems: NK − LANDSCAPE and k-MAXSAT problems. Our results show that the CC-(1+1) EA perform similarly to the (1+1) EA on these problems. However, adjusting block length allows us to optimise its performance on the NK − LANDSCAPE problem. Our results provide a more precise bound for the expected runtime of CC-(1+1) EA and a more detailed empirical analysis of its behaviour on more complicated inseparable problems.},

 abstract = {The self-adjusting (1 + (λ, λ)) GA is the best known genetic algorithm for problems with a good fitness-distance correlation as in OneMax. It uses a parameter control mechanism for the parameter λ that governs the mutation strength and the number of offspring. However, on multimodal problems, the parameter control mechanism tends to increase λ uncontrollably. We study this problem for the standard Jumpk benchmark problem class using runtime analysis. The self-adjusting (1 + (λ, λ)) GA behaves like a (1 + n) EA whenever the maximum value for λ is reached. This is ineffective for problems where large jumps are required. Capping λ at smaller values is beneficial for such problems. Finally, resetting λ to 1 allows the parameter to cycle through the parameter space. We show that resets are effective for all Jumpk problems: the self-adjusting (1 + (λ, λ)) GA performs as well as the (1 + 1) EA with the optimal mutation rate and evolutionary algorithms with heavy-tailed mutation, apart from a small polynomial overhead. Along the way, we present new general methods for translating existing runtime bounds from the (1 + 1) EA to the self-adjusting (1 + (λ, λ)) GA. We also show that the algorithm presents a bimodal parameter landscape with respect to λ on Jumpk. For appropriate n and k, the landscape features a local optimum in a wide basin of attraction and a global optimum in a narrow basin of attraction. To our knowledge this is the first proof of a bimodal parameter landscape for the runtime of an evolutionary algorithm on a multimodal problem.},

 abstract = {Recent works showed that simple success-based rules for self-adjusting parameters in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can match or outperform the best fixed parameters on discrete problems. Non-elitism in a (1, λ) EA combined with a self-adjusting of spring population size λ outperforms common EAs on the multimodal Cliff problem. However, it was shown that this only holds if the success rate λ that governs self-adjustment is small enough. Otherwise, even on OneMax, the self-adjusting (1, λ) EA stagnates on an easy slope, where frequent successes drive down the of spring population size. We show that self-adjustment works as intended in the absence of easy slopes. We define everywhere hard functions, for which successes are never easy to find and show that the self-adjusting (1, λ) EA is robust with respect to the choice of success rates λ. We give a general fitness-level upper bound on the number of evaluations and show that the expected number of generations is at most [EQUATION] where d is the number of non-optimal fitness values and [EQUATION] is the smallest probability of finding an improvement from a non-optimal search point. We discuss implications for the everywhere hard function LeadingOnes and a new class OneMaxBlocks of everywhere hard functions with tunable difficulty.},

There is no lower bound on the expected runtime under the same parameter settings. It also remains unknown whether the algorithm can still optimise the LeadingOnes function within a polynomial runtime when \$\${\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}ge {\textbackslash}lambda /(e(1+{\textbackslash}delta ))\$\$. In case of the PBIL, an expected runtime of \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{2+c\})\$\$holds for some constant \$\$c {\textbackslash}in (0,1)\$\$(Wu, Kolonko and Möhring, IEEE TEVC 2017).

Furthermore, the required population size is very large, i.e., \$\${\textbackslash}lambda ={\textbackslash}Omega (n{\textasciicircum}\{1+c\})\$\$.

Most existing runtime analyses focus on elitist EAs on simple problems, for which moderate performance gains were shown. Here we consider a much more challenging scenario: the multimodal function Cliff, defined as an example where a (1, λ) EA is effective, and for which the best known upper runtime bound for standard EAs is O(n25). We prove that a (1, λ) EA self-adjusting the offspring population size λ using success-based rules optimises Cliff in O(n) expected generations and O(n log n) expected evaluations. Along the way, we prove tight upper and lower bounds on the runtime for fixed λ (up to a logarithmic factor) and identify the runtime for the best fixed λ as nη for η ≈ 3.9767 (up to sub-polynomial factors). Hence, the self-adjusting (1, λ) EA outperforms the best fixed parameter by a factor of at least n2.9767 (up to sub-polynomial factors).},

However, the majority of these studies concerned elitist algorithms and we do not have a clear answer on whether the same mechanisms can be applied for non-elitist algorithms. We study one of the best-known parameter control mechanisms, the one-fifth success rule, to control the offspring population size λ in the non-elitist (1, λ) EA. It is known that the (1, λ) EA has a sharp threshold with respect to the choice of λ where the runtime on OneMax changes from polynomial to exponential time. Hence, it is not clear whether parameter control mechanisms are able to find and maintain suitable values of λ. We show that the answer crucially depends on the success rate s (i. e. a one-(s + 1)-th success rule). We prove that, if the success rate is appropriately small, the self-adjusting (1, λ) EA optimises OneMax in O(n) expected generations and O(n log n) expected evaluations. A small success rate is crucial: we also show that if the success rate is too large, the algorithm has an exponential runtime on OneMax.},

In the last years there have been proposed several mechanisms of success-based parameter control in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and compare their sequential optimisation time and parallelisation on different types of problems. The geometric mean of the sequential and parallel optimisation times is used as a new metric to evaluate the parallelisation of the EAs capturing the trade off between both optimisation times. We perform an empirical study comprising of 9 different algorithms on four benchmark functions. From the 9 algorithms eight algorithms were taken from the literature and one is a modification proposed here. We show that the modified algorithms has a 20\% faster sequential optimisation time than the fastest known GA on OneMax. Additionally we show the benefits of success-based parameter control mechanisms for NP-hard problems and using the proposed metric we also show that success-based offspring population size mechanisms are outperformed by static choices in parallel EAs.},

 abstract = {Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are stochastic heuristics that search for optimal solutions by learning and sampling from probabilistic models. Despite their popularity in real-world applications, there is little rigorous understanding of their performance. Even for the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA)—a simple population-based EDA assuming independence between decision variables—the optimisation time on the linear problem OneMax was until recently undetermined. The incomplete theoretical understanding of EDAs is mainly due to the lack of appropriate analytical tools. We show that the recently developed level-based theorem for non-elitist populations combined with anti-concentration results yield upper bounds on the expected optimisation time of the UMDA. This approach results in the bound \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}{\textbackslash}left( n{\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}lambda +n{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}right) \$\$on the LeadingOnes and BinVal problems for population sizes \$\${\textbackslash}lambda {\textgreater}{\textbackslash}mu ={\textbackslash}varOmega ({\textbackslash}log n)\$\$, where \$\${\textbackslash}mu \$\$and \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$are parameters of the algorithm. We also prove that the UMDA with population sizes \$\${\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}{\textbackslash}left( {\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}{\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}cap {\textbackslash}varOmega ({\textbackslash}log n)\$\$optimises OneMax in expected time \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}{\textbackslash}left( {\textbackslash}lambda n{\textbackslash}right) \$\$, and for larger population sizes \$\${\textbackslash}mu ={\textbackslash}varOmega ({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}{\textbackslash}log n)\$\$, in expected time \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}{\textbackslash}left( {\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}{\textbackslash}right) \$\$. The facility and generality of our arguments suggest that this is a promising approach to derive bounds on the expected optimisation time of EDAs.},

@article{dang_populations_2017,
 abstract = {Real-world optimisation problems are often dynamic. Previously good solutions must be updated or replaced due to changes in objectives and constraints. It is often claimed that evolutionary algorithms are particularly suitable for dynamic optimisation because a large population can contain different solutions that may be useful in the future. However, rigorous theoretical demonstrations for how populations in dynamic optimisation can be essential are sparse and restricted to special cases. This paper provides theoretical explanations of how populations can be essential in evolutionary dynamic optimisation in a general and natural setting. We describe a natural class of dynamic optimisation problems where a sufficiently large population is necessary to keep track of moving optima reliably. We establish a relationship between the population-size and the probability that the algorithm loses track of the optimum.},

@article{corus_level-based_2017,
 abstract = {Understanding how the time complexity of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) depend on their parameter settings and characteristics of fitness landscapes is a fundamental problem in evolutionary computation. Most rigorous results were derived using a handful of key analytic techniques, including drift analysis. However, since few of these techniques apply effortlessly to population-based EAs, most time complexity results concern simple EAs, such as the (1+1) EA. We present the level-based theorem, a new technique tailored to population-based processes. It applies to any non-elitist process where offspring are sampled independently from a distribution depending only on the current population. Given conditions on this distribution, our technique provides upper bounds on the expected time until the process reaches a target state. The technique is demonstrated on pseudo-Boolean functions, the sorting problem, and approximation of optimal solutions in combinatorial optimisation. The conditions of the theorem are often straightforward to verify, even for Genetic Algorithms and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms which were considered highly non-trivial to analyse. The proofs for the example applications are available in the supplementary materials. Finally, we prove that the theorem is nearly optimal for the processes considered: Given the information the theorem requires about the process, a much tighter bound cannot be proved.},

@article{dang_runtime_2016,
 abstract = {Although widely applied in optimisation, relatively little has been proven rigorously about the role and behaviour of populations in randomised search processes. This paper presents a new method to prove upper bounds on the expected optimisation time of population-based randomised search heuristics that use non-elitist selection mechanisms and unary variation operators. Our results follow from a detailed drift analysis of the population dynamics in these heuristics. This analysis shows that the optimisation time depends on the relationship between the strength of the selective pressure and the degree of variation introduced by the variation operator. Given limited variation, a surprisingly weak selective pressure suffices to optimise many functions in expected polynomial time. We derive upper bounds on the expected optimisation time of non-elitist evolutionary algorithms (EA) using various selection mechanisms, including fitness proportionate selection. We show that EAs using fitness proportionate selection can optimise standard benchmark functions in expected polynomial time given a sufficiently low mutation rate. As a second contribution, we consider an optimisation scenario with partial information, where fitness values of solutions are only partially available. We prove that non-elitist EAs under a set of specific conditions can optimise benchmark functions in expected polynomial time, even when vanishingly little information about the fitness values of individual solutions or populations is available. To our knowledge, this is the first runtime analysis of randomised search heuristics under partial information.},

Subsequently, a wealth of empirical studies have been published that evaluate the performance of these algorithms on a variety of benchmark problems. However, very few theoretical results have been obtained during this time. This relative lack of theoretical findings makes it difficult to fully assess the strengths and weaknesses of the individual algorithms. In this chapter we provide a review of theoretical advances in evolutionary dynamic optimization. In particular, we argue the importance of theoretical results, highlight the challenges faced by theoreticians and summarise the work that has been done to date. We subsequently identify relevant directions for future research.},

@article{lehre_runtime_2009,
 abstract = {Many software engineering tasks can potentially be automated using search heuristics. However, much work is needed in designing and evaluating search heuristics before this approach can be routinely applied to a software engineering problem. Experimental methodology should be complemented with theoretical analysis to achieve this goal. Recently, there have been significant theoretical advances in the runtime analysis of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and other search heuristics in other problem domains. We suggest that these methods could be transferred and adapted to gain insight into the behaviour of search heuristics on software engineering problems while automating software engineering.},
