<h2>Teaching</h2>
(I currently have no teaching and admin duties as my time
over the next years is bought out by my Turing AI fellowship.)
<ul>
  <li>Neural Computation (Autumn 2020, co-taught with Jinming Duan,
    Yunwen Lei and Shan He)</li>
  <li>Nature Inspired Search and Optimisation (Spring 2020, co-taught with Shan He)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li>Theoretical aspects of evolutionary computation.</li> -->
<!-- <li>Search based software engineering.</li> -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<p>
  My research interests are in theory of evolutionary computation,
  population genetics, randomised algorithms and related topics.
</p>

<h2>Open PhD Scholarship</h2>
      <p>We are currently looking for one PhD student to be associated
	with my Turing AI Acceleration fellowship project on
	co-evolution. If you are interested in theory of evolutionary
	computation, particularly runtime analysis, please get in
	touch with me or <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/research/computer-science/computer-science-phd.aspx?OpenSection=HowToApply">apply directly here</a>.
